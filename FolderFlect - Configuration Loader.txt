FolderFlect - Configuration Loader
FolderFlect's Configuration Loader is a utility tool designed to read configurations for folder synchronization. The primary purpose is to ensure that your source and replica directories are always in sync.

How to Use
To use the Configuration Loader, you need to provide specific arguments when invoking the application. Below are the required arguments:

-source: Specifies the path to the source directory.
-replica: Specifies the path to the replica directory.
-interval: Defines the synchronization interval in seconds.
-log: Specifies the path to save the log file.

Example

FolderFlect -source C:\path\to\sourceFolder -replica D:\path\to\replicaFolder -interval 60 -log C:\path\to\log.txt
This command will set up FolderFlect to synchronize the source directory at C:\path\to\sourceFolder  with the replica at D:\path\to\replica\sourceFolder, doing so every 60 seconds, and logging activities to C:\path\to\log.txt.

Warnings
Administrator Rights: When planning to synchronize folders in the root directory or system folders, you MUST run FolderFlect with administrator rights to ensure proper permissions and prevent potential data loss.
Always remember to have a backup of essential data before initiating any synchronization activity. Ensure you understand the implications of your actions when working with root directories or system files.
